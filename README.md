Guessing Game

📌 Overview
The Guessing Game is a fun, interactive program where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. It demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, randomization, and user input handling.

🚀 Features
- Random number generation within a configurable range
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Input validation to prevent crashes
- Feedback after each guess (too high / too low)
- Tracks number of attempts and displays results
- Replay option to start a new round without restarting the program

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: Python (replace with your language if different)
- Modules: random, sys (optional)
- Concepts: Loops, conditionals, functions, error handling


🎯 How to Play
- The program generates a random number.
- Enter your guess when prompted.
- The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
- Your total attempts will be displayed at the end.

🧩 Example Gameplay
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 63
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.


📈 Future Improvements
- Add a scoring system based on attempts
- Implement multiplayer mode
- Create a GUI version using Tkinter or a web framework
- Save high scores to a file or database
- Add difficulty scaling (dynamic ranges)
